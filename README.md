# HealthPredictorXGB

## Disease Prediction Using Symptoms

This project uses machine learning to predict diseases based on symptoms using the **XGBoost** algorithm. The model is trained using a dataset of common symptoms and their corresponding diseases.

### Features:
- Predict diseases based on a given set of symptoms.
- Model trained using **XGBoost** to achieve high accuracy.
- Includes pre-processed datasets for both training and testing.

### Requirements:
To run the code, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `xgboost`
- `sklearn`
- `flask` (if using the app)

You can install the dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
